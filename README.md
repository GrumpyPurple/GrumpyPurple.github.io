## Explore My Collection of Projects

Most of my work is not shared publicly. This collection does not comprehensively represent my work.

### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html)

I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- Names composed of different syllables
- Demographic details about the character
- A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.

### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html)

On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- Indicates the current time
- Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- Pulses like your heart
- You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.

### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html)

A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.

### [Story Teller](StoryTeller/StoryTeller.html)

I developed an app that emulates the game Madlibs. I experimented with a more noir feeling, including music, a typing effect, and a significant amount of string manipulation. Music sourced from [fesliyanstudios](https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/):

- Fantasy song is Elven Forest
- Science Fiction song is Final Descent
- Mystery song is Fallen Petals

### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html)

Incomplete. I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over.

### [Meal Planner](MealPlanner/MealPlanner.html)

Incomplete. Intended to help me plan out my meals. I plan on storing a variety of regular meals in JSON, then allowing for search by criteria.
