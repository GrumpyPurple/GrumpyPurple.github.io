## Completed Projects

### [Persona 5 Royal Guide](Persona5RoyalGuide/index.html)

I wanted an elegant guide styled after the game to occupy my second screen while playing. Other guides would require you to keep track of the day you were up to by scrolling through difficult to read whole pages of text, require you to switch tabs for negotiations and part time quizes.

- [x] Full 300 days of day by day guidance
- [x] Guide for selecting Flowers
- [x] Guide for finding barcodes in convenience store
- [x] Guide for shadow negotiations
- [ ] Guide for fusion (WIP)
- [x] Saves date you are up to
- [x] Neato little knife animation / sound effect when selected date
- [x] Press numpad +/- to go to next/prev day
- [x] Mobile Friendly


### [The Collector](TheCollector/TheCollector.html)

Idle Collection game. To my knowledge the first of it's kind.

- [x] 96 different items
- [x] 32 different combos
- [x] Upgrade store
- [x] 4 different zones
- [x] Sound effects
- [x] Automatic Save system with manual, import and export saves


### [Meal Planner](MealPlanner/MealPlanner.html)

Intended to help me plan out my meals.

- [x] 33 different meals of varying quality
- [x] Creates a Meal Plan
- [x] Can view full recipes by selecting the meals
- [x] Creates a Shopping list
- [x] Can tick off items on the shopping list
- [x] Includes [Recipe Maker](MealPlanner/RecipeMaker.html) - a tool for making the json recipes the app uses.
- [x] Includes [Recipe Browser](MealPlanner/RecipeBrowser.html) - for if you want to search for a recipe instead of being assigned.


### [Idle Landlord](IdleLandlord/IdleLandlord.html)

I've wanted to make a clicker game for a while. The king of passive income is landlording, so I really wanted to make landlord themed clicker game. Features:

- [x] Work a job and get promoted
- [x] 7 properties you can buy
- [x] Upgrade Properties to earn more
- [x] Auto-save and manual saving to cookies
- [x] Importing/Exporting saves to JSON
- [x] Unique mobile layout


### [Story Teller](StoryTeller/StoryTeller.html)

I developed an app that emulates the game Madlibs. Features:

- [x] 16 different stories
- [x] Page design to match the mood of the story
- [x] Complete the story by filling in the missing words
- [x] Watch as the story unfolds keystroke at a time accompanied by 7 different musical tracks
- [x] Adjustable Text-speed and audio fade
- [x] support for making and importing custom stories via the [Story Maker](StoryTeller/StoryMaker.html)


### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html)

A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- [x] Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- [x] Settings to decide the chance of tail/wings
- [x] Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization
- [x] 461 Animals!
- [x] Click the name of an animal to be redirected to Bing images in a new tab!

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.


### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html)

I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- [x] Names composed of different syllables
- [x] Demographic details about the character
- [x] A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.


### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html)

On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- [x] Indicates the current time
- [x] Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- [x] Pulses like your heart
- [x] You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.


### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html)

I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over. Features:

- [x] Scrambles input text into a semi-comprehensible mess
