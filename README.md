Most of my work is not shared publicly. This collection does not comprehensively represent my work.

### [Story Teller](StoryTeller/StoryTeller.html)

I developed an app that emulates the game Madlibs. Features:

- [x] 16 different stories
- [x] Page design to match the mood of the story
- [x] Complete the story by filling in the missing words
- [x] Watch as the story unfolds keystroke at a time accompanied by [7 differnt musical tracks](StoryTeller/README.md)
- [x] Adjustable Text-speed and audiofade
- [x] NEW: support for making and importing custom stories via the [Story Maker](https://jordan-heath.github.io/StoryTeller/StoryMaker/StoryMaker.html)

### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html)

I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- [x] Names composed of different syllables
- [x] Demographic details about the character
- [x] A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.

### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html)

A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- [x] Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- [x] Settings to decide the chance of tail/wings
- [x] Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization
- [x] NEW: 461 Animals! Sourced from [Here](https://gist.github.com/atduskgreg/3cf8ef48cb0d29cf151bedad81553a54), sorted, and reduced.
- [x] NEW: Click the name of an animal to be redirected to bing images in a new tab!

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.

### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html)

On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- [x] Indicates the current time
- [x] Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- [x] Pulses like your heart
- [x] You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.

### [Idle Landlord](IdleLandlord/IdleLandlord.html)

WORK IN PROGRESS. I've wanted to make a clicker game for a while. The king of passive income is landlording, so I really wanted to make 'Idle Landlord' the 1980s aesthetic clicker game. Features:

- [x] 1980s aesthetic
- [ ] Gambling-style feedback
- [ ] Auto-save and manual saving to cookies
- [ ] Importing/Exporting saves to json

### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html)

WORK IN PROGRESS. I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over. Features:

- [x] Scrambles input text into incomprehensible mess

### [Meal Planner](MealPlanner/MealPlanner.html)

WORK IN PROGRESS. Intended to help me plan out my meals. I plan on storing a variety of regular meals in JSON, then allowing for search by criteria.
