### [Idle Landlord](IdleLandlord/IdleLandlord.html)

I've wanted to make a clicker game for a while. The king of passive income is landlording, so I really wanted to make 'Idle Landlord' the 1970s aesthetic clicker game. Features:

- [x] 1970s aesthetic
- [x] Work a job and get promoted
- [x] 7 properties you can buy
- [x] Upgrade Properties to earn more
- [x] Auto-save and manual saving to cookies
- [x] Importing/Exporting saves to JSON

### [Story Teller](StoryTeller/StoryTeller.html)

- [x] 16 different stories
- [x] Page design to match the mood of the story
- [x] Complete the story by filling in the missing words
- [x] Watch as the story unfolds keystroke at a time accompanied by [7 different musical tracks](StoryTeller/README.md)
- [x] Adjustable Text-speed and audio fade
- [x] support for making and importing custom stories via the [Story Maker](StoryTeller/StoryMaker.html)


### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html)

A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- [x] Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- [x] Settings to decide the chance of tail/wings
- [x] Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization
- [x] 461 Animals!
- [x] Click the name of an animal to be redirected to Bing images in a new tab!

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.


### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html)

I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- [x] Names composed of different syllables
- [x] Demographic details about the character
- [x] A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.


### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html)

On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- [x] Indicates the current time
- [x] Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- [x] Pulses like your heart
- [x] You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.


### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html)

I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over. Features:

- [x] Scrambles input text into a semi-comprehensible mess


## Incomplete Projects

### [RPG Chat](RPGChat/RPGchat.html)
