            <p>Most of my work I am not sharing publicly. This is not a thorough representation of my work.</p>

            <h3 onclick="location.href='CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html'">Character Generator</h3>
            <p>I was familiar with name generators, but i wanted to have my own spin on it by adding a few extra
                features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Names composed of different sylabols</li>
                <li>A few demographic details about the character</li>
                <li>A stat list for each character</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The characters come out pretty silly, but I thought it was fun.</p>

            <h3 onclick="location.href='PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html'">Percentage Clock</h3>
            <p>On hard days its nice to know how much of the day you need to get through before its over. Percentage
                clock gives it in a simple number. It doesn't provide much comfort as i got a little carried away with
                the css animation library. A few features are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kind of tells you the time</li>
                <li>Transitions from red to green throughout the day</li>
                <li>Pulses like your heart does</li>
                <li>You can press on the number and it makes an annoying noise that raises in pitch and makes you feel
                    uneasy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wouldn't recommend this one</p>

            <h3 onclick="location.href='ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html'">Manticore Generator</h3>
            <p>A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on making some manticores for a personal
                project. they asked if i could make something similar to help them with the process. I added a few extra
                features to help them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Random chance of not adding tail/wings</li>
                <li>Able to lock body parts so they aren't randomised</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Otherwise it is very similar to CharacterGenerator</p>

            <h3 onclick="location.href='WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html'">Word Scrambler</h3>
            <p>Incomplete. I made this a while ago to try and replicate a horrible mode of speech I was exposed to. I
                just need to port it over</p>

            <h3 onclick="location.href='MealPlanner/MealPlanner.html'">Meal Planner</h3>
            <p>Incomplete. Intended to help me plan out my meals. I plan on storing a lot of regular meals in json, then
                allowing to search by criteria.</p>
