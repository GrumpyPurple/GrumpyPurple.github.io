Gameplay: 
    The player has 10 weeks to accomplish their goals
    each day, the player can select one of the following actions:
        Gather resources (+ wealth, random events that may increase/decrease wealth at the tradeoff of other values),
        Help your people (+ welfare, random events that may increase/decrease welfare at the tradeoff of other values),
        Diplomacy (+ foreign relations, random events that may increase/decrease foreign relations at the tradeoff of other values),
        Build military force (+ military strength, random events that may increase/decrease military strength at the tradeoff of other values),
        Set Policy (Random Bonus, Random Malus),
    Depending on which they select, a positive effect will be applied, then a random event where the player will make a choice.
    For example:
        The player is playing as humans and has the Famine crisis, and needs to improve welfare
        The player selects "Help your people"
        This improves welfare by 1
        The player gets a random event - the elven villagers on the town outskirts do not have easy access to water and would like a well to be built
        The player has to choose whether:
            to spend 2 gold to build a well to improve welfare and foreign relations
            to use the military to force out the elven villagers, gaining 1 military strength, 1 welfare and losing 1 foreign relations
            to do nothing, losing 1 welfare and 1 foreign relations
